# R-Machine-Learning-Competition
Code uses a number of methods in R Cran library H2o to train an optimal model through trial and error of the prediction score. Gradient boosted decision trees were found to be most effective for the dataset provided.

I hope this repo will give you a look into ML in R by giving you ideas for your own approach.

Best of luck,
